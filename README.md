In this project I studied the redirections and the pipes. 

The programm name - pipex, it takes as a parameter 1 file with some information inside, 
reads this information, sends it to the pipe, where, on the other side - 
writes to the new file, sometimes - after after applying some commands to the contents 
of the first file.
